As a conference organiser, i.e. event manager, make sure that you are on the Indico page and that you are logged in.
Click on the tab _Create event_, and click on _Create conference_.

The initial steps are similar across Indico event creation. Please read the **Meeting** section of this documentation, if needed.
The general data you'll enter when creating your conference will constitute the _Overview_.
